"""Domain model test suite.

Validates the core domain model foundations that underpin our transformation pipeline.
These tests verify that our domain entities maintain strict immutability while
enabling functional transformations - a pattern proven successful in production
streaming platforms.

Test success means:
1. Domain models enforce immutability at all levels
2. Business rule validation prevents invalid states
3. Transformations produce new instances with correct state
4. Operations compose predictably and maintain data integrity
