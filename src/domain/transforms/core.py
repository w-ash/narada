"""
Pure functional transformations for playlists and tracks.

This module contains immutable, side-effect free functions that transform
domain models. These primitives form the foundation of our workflow system.

Transformations follow functional programming principles:
- Immutability: All operations return new objects instead of modifying existing ones
- Composition: Transformations can be combined to form complex pipelines
- Currying: Functions are designed to work with partial application
- Purity: No side effects or external dependencies
