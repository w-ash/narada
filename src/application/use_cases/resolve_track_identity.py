"""Track identity resolution use case implementing Clean Architecture patterns.

This module contains the core business logic for resolving track identities across
music services, following Clean Architecture principles:
- Command pattern for rich context encapsulation
- Batch-first design (single items are degenerate cases)
- Use case orchestrates business logic, delegates infrastructure concerns
- Domain entities for input/output, no infrastructure types exposed

    Used by:
    - Enrichment workflows (to establish track identity before fetching metrics)
    - Sync operations (to map tracks between different services)
    - Playlist operations (to resolve track identities for cross-service operations)
    - MatchTracksUseCase (backward compatibility wrapper)
    
    Migrated to UnitOfWork pattern for pure Clean Architecture compliance:
    - No constructor dependencies (pure domain layer)
    - Explicit transaction control through UnitOfWork parameter
    - Simplified testing with single UnitOfWork mock
    - Consistent pattern with all other use cases
