"""UpdatePlaylist use case implementing sophisticated differential playlist synchronization.

This module provides the core business logic for updating existing playlists with
minimal operations (add/remove/reorder) rather than naive replacement, preserving
track addition timestamps and providing superior user experience.

Key Features:
- Differential algorithm calculating minimal operations for Spotify API
- Track matching across services (Spotify ID, ISRC, metadata similarity)
- Operation sequencing to avoid index conflicts (remove→add→move)
- Batch optimization within API constraints (100 tracks/request)
- Conflict detection and resolution using snapshot_id validation
- Extensible design for future streaming services (Apple Music, etc.)
