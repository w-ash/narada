## Planned Roadmap 🚀

### v0.2.4: Playlist Workflow Expansion
**Goal**: Enable advanced playlist workflows, including using plays for filtering and discovery workflows

#### Foundational Epics (Pre-Feature Work)
**Goal**: Solidify the Clean Architecture implementation and resolve key technical debt to prepare for advanced playlist workflow features. This foundational work ensures new features are built on a stable, testable, and maintainable platform.

**Architectural Note on Sequencing**: These epics are sequenced to prevent rework. The data flow (`MatcherService`) is clarified first, followed by the general dependency injection pattern, and finally the `UpdatePlaylistUseCase` is completed, integrating with the new, stable components.

- [ ] **Clarify Enrichment vs. Matching Data Flow**
    - Effort: M
    - What: Decouple the expensive process of *identity resolution* (matching new, unknown tracks) from the cheap process of *metadata enrichment* (refreshing data for known tracks).
    - Why: The current `MatcherService` blurs these two distinct concerns. A clear separation will make the system more efficient (avoids re-matching known tracks), easier to reason about, and simplifies the data flow for both new and existing tracks.
    - Dependencies: Clean Architecture Migration
    - Status: Not Started
    - Notes:
        - Refactor `MatcherService` to only handle *identity resolution* for unknown tracks.
        - Create a new, simple `EnricherService` or use case to refresh metadata for known tracks based on a `last_updated` timestamp.
        - This simplifies components like `MetadataFreshnessController` and makes the data flow more explicit and efficient.

- [ ] **Refactor Use Cases for True Dependency Inversion**
    - Effort: M
    - What: Refactor all Application Use Cases (e.g., `SavePlaylistUseCase`, `UpdatePlaylistUseCase`) to be pure orchestrators. They must receive repository and strategy *interfaces* (protocols) via dependency injection instead of creating concrete instances or accessing the database session directly.
    - Why: This is the most critical step to fully realize the benefits of Clean Architecture. It will make our business logic 100% independent of the database, dramatically improving testability (no more mocking `get_session`), and making the system more adaptable to future changes.
    - Dependencies: Clarify Enrichment vs. Matching Data Flow
    - Status: Not Started
    - Notes:
        - Define repository and strategy protocols in the `domain` layer.
        - Update use cases to accept these protocols in their `__init__` methods.
        - Wire up concrete implementations (e.g., `SQLAlchemyTrackRepository`) at the outermost layer (CLI command or workflow node).

- [ ] **Complete UpdatePlaylistUseCase Implementation**
    - Effort: L
    - What: Replace placeholder implementations and simplified logic with production-ready Spotify API operations and sophisticated reordering algorithms.
    - Why: Current implementation contains TODOs for critical features including sophisticated reordering logic, ISRC/metadata matching strategies, and actual Spotify API operations (currently creates new playlists instead of updating existing ones).
    - Dependencies: Refactor Use Cases for True Dependency Inversion
    - Status: Not Started
    - Notes:
        - **TODO(#123)**: Implement sophisticated reordering logic for playlist updates
        - **TODO(#125)**: Replace placeholder with actual Spotify API operations (add/remove/reorder tracks)
        - Address "simplified positioning for now" and "move operations simplified for now" in differential algorithm
        - File: `src/application/use_cases/update_playlist.py:261,266,292,512,549`

- [ ] **Technical Debt Cleanup**
    - Effort: M
    - What: Address remaining technical debt, including consolidating playlist persistence logic, improving type safety, and cleaning up the workflow context architecture.
    - Why: To maintain code quality and architectural integrity, ensuring the codebase remains clean, modern, and easy to work with before adding new features.
    - Dependencies: Refactor Use Cases for True Dependency Inversion
    - Status: Not Started
    - Notes:
        - Consolidate `SavePlaylistUseCase` and `UpdatePlaylistUseCase` responsibilities.
        - Replace `Any` types in repository interfaces with specific domain entities.
        - Remove the "hack" in `LazyRepositoryProvider` with proper dependency injection.

#### Play History Analysis Epics
- [x] **Informative and Easy-to-use CLI**
    - Effort: S
    - What: Improve usability of the CLI while ensuring we won't need to refactor when creating the web interface vie FastAPI
    - Why: Before we add more functionality, we need to ensure our CLI is up to the task of handling more options. users should clearly see what they can do, and be able to accomplish those things with minimal typing.

- [ ] **Advanced Track Matching Strategies**
    - Effort: M

    - Status: Not Started
    - Notes:
        - Implement ISRC-based matching for high-confidence identity resolution

        - Support fallback strategies when primary matching fails
        - Maintain existing Spotify ID matching as fastest path
        - File: `src/application/use_cases/update_playlist.py` (currently uses simple Spotify ID matching)

- [ ] **Enhanced Playlist Naming**
    - Effort: M
    - What: Add update and parameterization capability to destination nodes that create playlists

    - Effort: M
    - What: Add a `narada spotify playlists --list` command to display a user's Spotify playlists, including name, owner (self/other), and track count.
    - Why: Users need a clear inventory before managing playlists. The command provides an organized view to aid selection.
    - CLI Design:
        - Use a tabular format with `rich` for readability (name, owner, tracks).
        - Support filtering by owner (`--self`, `--other`), and sorting (e.g., by name or track count).
        - Web UI Consideration: The command's output format should be easily adaptable to a web-based playlist table.
    - Dependencies: Matcher System Modernization
    - Status: Not Started

    - Dependencies: Discover Spotify Playlists
    - Status: Not Started

- [ ] **Efficiently Sync Tracked Playlists**
    - Effort: L
    - What: Create `narada sync spotify-playlists` to efficiently update "tracked" playlists with changes from Spotify using the `snapshot_id`.
    - Why: Maintains up-to-date backups, protecting against data loss and powering downstream workflows. Efficiency is key for user experience.
    - CLI Design:
        - Use `snapshot_id` to minimize API calls: compare local and remote IDs, fetching full track lists only when necessary.
        - Provide concise feedback: `"Synced <playlist_name> (<changes>), ..."`.
        - Implement a `--force` option to bypass `snapshot_id` check and force a full refresh.
        - Web UI Consideration: This sync operation could be triggered by a "Sync Now" button in the web UI, or run periodically in the background.

    - Why: A highly requested feature, but complex due to conflict resolution challenges.
    - Notes: This would involve careful design decisions around conflict resolution strategies (e.g., last-write-wins, manual override). Consider this a significant undertaking for a later milestone (e.g., v0.6.0 or later).

- [ ] **Playlist Diffing and Merging (Advanced)**
    - Effort: L
    - What: Develop tools to visualize differences between local and Spotify playlists and provide options for merging changes selectively.
