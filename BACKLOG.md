# Project Narada Backlog

**Current Version**: 0.2.3 (in progress)  
**Status**: Clean Architecture migration complete, modern testing architecture in progress

## Overview
Narada has evolved from a simple music sync tool into a sophisticated workflow platform with Clean Architecture foundations. We've completed cross-service synchronization, play history imports, and architectural modernization. Currently focusing on test architecture improvements before advancing to API and visualization features.

## Completed Milestones âœ…

### v0.2.0-0.2.2: Core Data Platform
**Achievement**: Complete cross-service sync and play history platform

**Key Features Delivered**:
- âœ… **Spotify â†” Last.fm Sync**: Bidirectional likes synchronization 
- âœ… **Play History Import**: Spotify GDPR exports + Last.fm API with smart deduplication
- âœ… **Enhanced Track Resolution**: 100% processing rate for any age Spotify export
- âœ… **DRY Architecture**: Unified models, factory patterns, zero redundancy

### v0.2.3: Clean Architecture Foundation  
**Achievement**: Modern, maintainable codebase ready for scale

**Architecture Transformation**:
- âœ… **Clean Architecture**: Domain/Application/Infrastructure layers with proper boundaries
- âœ… **Dependency Injection**: Technology-agnostic business logic
- âœ… **Performance**: Domain tests 10x faster, maintained test coverage
- âœ… **Future-Ready**: Foundation for web APIs and modern frameworks

**Clean Architecture Initiative Completed**:
- âœ… **Phase 0: Project Structure Migration**: Migrated from legacy `/narada` to modern `/src` structure with consistent import paths
- âœ… **Phase 1: Repository Interface Consolidation**: Unified repository contracts in domain layer, eliminated 5 duplicate protocols
- âœ… **Phase 2: Service Layer Reorganization**: Moved business logic to application layer, deleted 7 redundant files, established proper CLI â†’ Application â†’ Domain flow
- âœ… **Phase 3: Architecture Compliance & Quality**: Verified Clean Architecture principles, updated to Python 3.13 patterns, maintained full test coverage
- âœ… **Phase 4: Modern Testing Architecture**: Replaced heavy async mocking with lightweight dependency injection, achieved 332/332 tests passing

**Detailed Migration Results**:
        - âœ… **Future-Ready**: Foundation established for FastAPI web interface with zero business logic changes needed
        - âœ… **Migration Complete**: Successfully migrated all imports from `narada.*` to `src.*` structure
        - âœ… **Old Code Removed**: Deleted legacy `/narada` directory after comprehensive verification
        - âœ… **Core Tests Passing**: 314/332 tests passing for CLI and integration functionality
        - **Result**: Clean Architecture migration complete, ready for web interface development

**Remaining Clean Architecture Work**:

- [x] **Modern Testing Architecture** (Phase 4)
    - Effort: M
    - What: Replace heavy async mocking with lightweight dependency injection patterns
    - Why: Brittle workflow tests were blocking progress due to complex mocking anti-patterns. Clean dependency injection enables fast, maintainable tests while preserving architectural boundaries.
    - Dependencies: Clean Architecture Restructuring
    - Status: Complete
    - Notes:
        - **Achievement**: 332/332 tests passing with clean linting
        - **Performance**: <10 second test runtime achieved
        - **Approach**: Function-level dependency injection with pytest fixtures

- [ ] **Matcher System Modernization** (Phase 5)
    - Effort: L
    - What: Decompose monolithic matcher into modular provider pattern
    - Why: Current 961-line matcher violates Single Responsibility Principle, mixing domain logic with service-specific API calls. Clean Architecture separation enables easier testing, maintenance, and extension to new music services.
    - Dependencies: Modern Testing Architecture
    - Status: Not Started
    - Notes:
        - **Problem**: Domain logic, API calls, and orchestration tangled together
        - **Solution**: Provider pattern with proper layer separation
        - **Benefit**: Adding new music services becomes trivial

- [ ] **Workflow Node Architecture** (Phase 6)
    - Effort: M
    - What: Extract playlist persistence logic into reusable Application Use Cases
    - Why: Current workflow nodes contain complex business logic that should live in Application layer. Proper separation prepares for modern workflow engines and web interface integration.
    - Dependencies: Matcher System Modernization
    - Status: Not Started
    - Notes:
        - **Problem**: Business process logic trapped in infrastructure layer
        - **Solution**: Dedicated Use Cases with proper dependency injection
        - **Benefit**: Ready for FastAPI, async patterns, and modern orchestration
