# Narada v0.2.4: Playlist Workflow Expansion

**Vision**: Transform playlist creation from static collections to intelligent, data-driven experiences using play history analysis and workflow automation.

**Status**: Database Architecture Complete ✅ | Next: Clean Architecture Compliance

---

## What Makes Narada Unique

### Intelligent Track Resolution ✅
Cross-service identity mapping across Spotify/Last.fm/MusicBrainz using multiple signals (ISRC, metadata, user behavior) with freshness-aware caching and confidence-based matching.

### Workflow-Driven Architecture ✅
Declarative JSON workflows with composable transformations: Filter → Enrich → Sort → Combine → Deliver pipeline. Context-aware nodes carry complete track context and metrics through execution.

### Play History Intelligence ✅
Unified filtering by play count and listening patterns with discovery engine for forgotten favorites, listening gaps, and never-played tracks. Single `filter.by_play_history` node supports flexible constraints.

## Architecture Foundation

### Clean Architecture Migration ✅ COMPLETED
**Achievement**: Complete Domain/Application/Infrastructure separation with proper dependency inversion
- **Domain**: Business logic isolated from framework concerns
- **Application**: Use cases orchestrate with injected interfaces  
- **Infrastructure**: Database, APIs, CLI implement domain/application interfaces
- **Test Pyramid**: Optimized from 45s→31s execution with proper layer classification

### Infrastructure Test Fixtures ✅ COMPLETED  
**Achievement**: 100% success rate (73/73 infrastructure tests) with proper entity separation
- **Entity Usage by Layer**: Domain uses `Track`, Infrastructure uses `DBTrack`, Connectors use service models
- **Database-First Workflow**: All workflow tracks require `track.id != None`
- **Conflict Prevention**: UUID-based unique identifiers in fixtures
- **Architecture Compliance**: Layer-specific fixtures in `tests/{layer}/conftest.py`

### Production Readiness ✅ COMPLETED
- **Sophisticated Playlist Updates**: Differential algorithms with optimal reordering (LIS algorithm)
- **Play History Intelligence**: Unified filtering with 19 workflow nodes
- **Platform-Agnostic Design**: Abstract interfaces support multiple streaming services
- **Test Coverage**: 592/593 tests passing (99.8% success rate)

## Current Development

### Sprint 5: Async Architecture & Database Concurrency ✅ COMPLETED
**Achievement**: Successfully resolved SQLite database lock errors through architectural improvements
**Impact**: Zero database lock errors, improved session management, maintained Clean Architecture principles

#### ✅ Solution Implementation Summary

**Key Architectural Fixes Applied**:

1. **Database Connection Management** (`db_connection.py`)
   - **Fixed**: Switched from `AsyncAdaptedQueuePool` to `NullPool` for SQLite
   - **Benefit**: Eliminates connection pooling issues that caused lock contention
   - **Configuration**: Proper SQLite pragmas (WAL mode, busy_timeout=30s, foreign keys)

2. **Progress Integration Refactor** (`progress_integration.py`)
   - **Replaced**: `@with_db_progress` decorator with `DatabaseProgressContext` async context manager
   - **Fixed**: Async flow issues - eliminated `asyncio.run()` inside decorators
   - **Pattern**: Session-per-operation prevents long-held database locks

3. **Workflow Session Management** (`prefect.py` + `context.py`)
   - **Implemented**: Single shared session per workflow execution
   - **Prevention**: Eliminates concurrent session creation that caused SQLite locks
   - **Architecture**: `SharedSessionProvider` properly manages session lifecycle

**Root Cause Resolution**:
- **Problem**: Multiple Prefect tasks creating concurrent AsyncSessions → SQLite database locks
- **Solution**: Single workflow-scoped session shared across all tasks
- **Result**: Zero "database is locked" errors, no connection leaks, maintained performance

## Upcoming: v0.2.4 Core Features

*After async cleanup completion, aligned with BACKLOG.md "Play History Analysis Epics":*

### Play History Filter and Sort (Medium Effort)
Extend existing filter/sorter architecture for play-based workflows:
- **Play Count Filtering**: Tracks played >10 times, <5 times, exact counts
- **Time-Period Analysis**: Tracks played >5 times in specific months/periods
- **Play Recency Sorting**: Most/least recently played tracks
- **Relative Time Periods**: Last 30 days, past week, this month
- **Discovery Gaps**: Never-played tracks, forgotten favorites

### Advanced Transformer Nodes (Medium Effort)
Additional transformation capabilities for powerful workflows:
- **Combining Operations**: Different merge strategies (interleave, weighted merge)
- **Time-Based Transformers**: Seasonal patterns, time of day filtering
- **Randomization**: Optional weighting for intelligent playlist shuffling
- **Selection Operations**: First X, last X, middle sections from tracklists

### Enhanced Playlist Naming (Medium Effort)
Dynamic naming and descriptions with metadata insertion:
- **Template Parameters**: `"Top {artist} from {year}"` style naming
- **Source Playlist Integration**: Use source playlist names in new names/descriptions
- **Date/Time Appending**: Automatic timestamps and date ranges
- **Metadata Insertion**: Track count, duration, genre information in descriptions

### Discovery Workflow Templates (Small Effort)
Pre-built workflow patterns leveraging play history capabilities:
- **"Hidden Gems"**: Low play count but high user rating tracks
- **"Seasonal Favorites"**: Tracks played heavily in specific seasons
- **"Rediscovery"**: Tracks not played recently but historically loved
- **"New vs Old"**: Compare recent discoveries with long-time favorites

## Technical Debt Resolution

*Critical pre-feature work from BACKLOG.md that enables v0.2.4 features:*

### High Priority (Blocks Feature Development)
- [ ] **Refactor Use Cases for True Dependency Inversion** (Medium)
  - Make use cases pure orchestrators receiving repository interfaces via dependency injection
  - Eliminate direct database session access from application layer
  - Enable 100% independent business logic testing without database mocking

- [ ] **Clarify Enrichment vs. Matching Data Flow** (Medium)
  - Separate expensive identity resolution (unknown tracks) from cheap metadata refresh (known tracks)
  - Create distinct EnricherService for known tracks vs MatcherService for unknown tracks
  - Simplify MetadataFreshnessController and make data flow explicit

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Complete UpdatePlaylistUseCase Implementation** (Large)
  - Replace TODOs with production Spotify API operations (currently creates new playlists)
  - Implement sophisticated reordering algorithms beyond current simplified positioning
  - Add ISRC/metadata matching strategies beyond simple Spotify ID matching

- [ ] **Repository Interface Type Safety** (Small)
  - Replace `Any` types in domain repository interfaces with proper domain entity types
  - Fix circular import issues using forward references or import restructuring
  - Eliminate type safety warnings and improve IDE support

### Lower Priority
- [ ] **Workflow Context Architecture Cleanup** (Medium)
  - Replace acknowledged "hack" in LazyRepositoryProvider with proper dependency injection
  - Implement proper dependency injection container for workflow execution
  - Remove session management responsibility from workflow context

## Key Architecture Decisions

### ADR-017: Async Context Manager Pattern ✅ COMPLETED
**Decision**: Replace @with_db_progress decorator with DatabaseProgressContext async context manager
**Why**: Decorator breaks async flow with asyncio.run(), violates Clean Architecture async patterns, creates event loop conflicts
**Impact**: Proper async flow, better composition, follows SQLAlchemy async session patterns, enables natural async/await usage

### ADR-016: Domain-First Fixture Architecture ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Decision**: Layer-specific fixtures with UUID-based unique identifiers and proper entity separation
**Why**: Prevents database conflicts, maintains Clean Architecture boundaries, enables 100% test success rate
**Impact**: Infrastructure tests use DBTrack models, domain tests use Track entities, connectors use service models

### ADR-015: Test Pyramid Optimization ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Decision**: Reclassify tests by architectural layer rather than consolidation approach
**Why**: Misclassified tests and slow fixtures were the real performance problem, not test count
**Impact**: 31% performance improvement (45s→31s), proper pyramid structure maintained

### Previous Architectural Foundations ✅
- **ADR-010**: Platform-agnostic playlist updates with PlaylistSyncService interface abstraction
- **ADR-011**: Longest Increasing Subsequence algorithm for optimal playlist reordering
- **ADR-013**: Unified play history filtering consolidation (21→19 workflow nodes)
- **ADR-014**: Production-first code review implementation achieving zero technical debt

## Next Development Phase: Clean Architecture Compliance

### High Priority Architectural Improvements
**Critical for maintainable codebase and future web interface development**

1. **Clean Architecture Violations** (High Priority)
   - **Issue**: 15+ application layer files directly import infrastructure classes
   - **Impact**: Violates dependency inversion, reduces testability, couples business logic to implementation
   - **Progress**: ✅ Fixed `progress_integration.py`, ✅ Partially fixed `import_tracks.py`
   - **Remaining Files**: `workflows/context.py`, `use_cases/sync_likes.py`, `use_cases/match_tracks.py`, `services/play_history_enricher.py`, `workflows/source_nodes.py`, `workflows/destination_nodes.py`, `workflows/node_factories.py`
   - **Solution**: Use dependency injection pattern, inject repository interfaces at composition root
   - **Pattern Established**: Session/repository factories injected at composition root (see `progress_integration.py`)

2. **Session Management Consistency** (Medium Priority)  
   - **Current**: Mixed patterns (workflow shared sessions vs individual use case sessions)
   - **Goal**: Unified session management strategy across all operations
   - **Benefit**: Prevents future database locking issues, clearer architecture boundaries

3. **Repository Interface Type Safety** (Low Priority)
   - **Issue**: `Any` types in domain repository interfaces to avoid circular imports
   - **Solution**: Forward references or import restructuring
   - **File**: `src/domain/repositories/interfaces.py:11`
