narada version
```

### Enhanced Spotify Track Resolution (v0.2.2)

Narada achieves **100% processing rate** for Spotify exports of any age:

#### Multi-Stage Resolution Pipeline
- **Stage 1**: Direct API lookup with automatic relinking detection (90%+ success)
- **Stage 2**: Metadata-based search fallback using confidence scoring (‚â•70% threshold)  
- **Stage 3**: Metadata preservation for complete data preservation (100% coverage)

#### Real-World Benefits
- **Handles any age of Spotify export** - from 2011 to present day
- **Zero data loss** - every play gets imported and tracked
- **Smart relinking detection** - automatically handles Spotify's track versioning
- **Rich visibility** - see exactly how each track was resolved

#### Example Resolution Output
```
üìä Enhanced Resolution Results:
   Resolution rate: 100.0%
   Direct ID: 2        (tracks found as-is)
   Relinked ID: 8     (tracks updated by Spotify)
   Search match: 0     (metadata-based fallback)
   Preserved metadata: 0  (unresolvable but saved)
   Total with track ID: 10
```

### Clean Architecture Foundation (v0.2.3)

Narada was restructured to Clean Architecture patterns to enable future expansion:

#### Technical Foundation
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic with zero external dependencies
- **Application Layer**: Use case orchestrators with dependency injection
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External services and interfaces
- **Performance**: Domain tests run 10x faster without database dependencies

#### Benefits for Users
- **Future Web Interface**: Foundation laid for web-based management alongside CLI
- **Faster Development**: New features can be added more quickly and safely
- **Better Testing**: More reliable tests lead to fewer bugs
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new music services and interfaces

### Modern CLI Experience

Narada features a beautiful, modern CLI with Rich-formatted output and intuitive navigation:

#### Visual Interface
- **Rich panels** with color-coded sections and emoji icons
- **Professional typography** with proper spacing and visual hierarchy  
- **Automatic version display** throughout the interface
- **Single help system** - `narada` shows comprehensive help

#### Flattened Command Structure
- **Descriptive names**: `import-spotify-plays`, `export-likes-to-lastfm` 
- **No nested commands**: All commands available at top level
- **Clear purpose**: Command names describe exactly what they do
- **Direct workflow execution**: `narada discovery_mix` (no more verbose commands!)
- **Short alias available**: `narada wf list` and `narada wf run`
- **Direct workflow execution** with simple command names

## Workflow System

Narada uses a powerful workflow system to create and transform playlists. Workflows are defined in JSON files and processed through a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of nodes.

### Running Workflows

Narada's workflow system features direct execution and rich visual feedback:

```bash
# Single help system shows all available commands and workflows
narada --help

# Data sync with descriptive command names
narada import-spotify-plays /path/to/spotify_export.json
narada import-spotify-likes --limit 500
narada export-likes-to-lastfm --batch-size 100

# Run workflows directly - no complex commands needed!
narada discovery_mix
narada sort_by_release_date

# Or use the workflow management interface
narada wf list              # List all workflows
narada wf run               # Interactive runner
```

#### Features

- **Direct Execution**: Run any workflow as a top-level command
- **Rich Progress Display**: Real-time progress tracking with visual feedback
- **Professional Output**: Beautiful tables and panels with color coding
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with helpful context
- **Auto-discovery**: New workflows automatically become available as commands

### Workflow Definition

Create custom workflows by defining JSON files in the definitions directory:

```json
{
  "id": "my_workflow",
  "name": "My Custom Workflow",
  "description": "Creates a personalized playlist based on my preferences",
  "version": "1.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "source_playlist",
      "type": "source.spotify_playlist",
      "config": {
        "playlist_id": "spotify_playlist_id_here"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "filter_recent",
      "type": "filter.by_release_date",
      "config": {
        "max_age_days": 90
      },
      "upstream": ["source_playlist"]
    },
    {
      "id": "destination",
      "type": "destination.create_spotify_playlist",
      "config": {
        "name": "My Recent Discoveries",
        "description": "Recently released tracks I might like"
      },
      "upstream": ["filter_recent"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Available Node Types

- **Sources**: Fetch tracks from Spotify playlists
- **Filters**: Filter tracks by various criteria (date, duplicates, etc.)
- **Enrichers**: Add metadata from Last.fm and other services
- **Sorters**: Sort tracks by popularity, play count, etc.
- **Combiners**: Merge, concatenate, or interleave playlists
- **Selectors**: Limit tracks based on various criteria
- **Destinations**: Create or update playlists in Spotify or internal database

See the Workflow Guide for a complete reference of available nodes and configuration options.

## Example Workflows

### Discovery Mix

The `discovery_mix` workflow creates a playlist of new releases from multiple curated sources:

1. Fetches tracks from multiple Spotify playlists (Pollen, Serotonin, Metropolis, Stereogum)
2. Filters each source to tracks released within the last 90 days
3. Limits each source to a specified number of tracks
4. Combines all sources and sorts by popularity
5. Appends Release Radar tracks at the beginning
6. Removes duplicates and tracks already in other playlists
7. Creates a new Spotify playlist with the results

Run this workflow with:

```bash
narada discovery_mix
```

## Architecture

Narada is built for reliability and performance:

- **Fast**: Optimized batch processing and async operations
- **Reliable**: Comprehensive error handling and data validation
- **Extensible**: Plugin-based workflow system for custom transformations
- **Type-Safe**: Full typing support for better development experience
